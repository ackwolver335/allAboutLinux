# Day 10 - Creating Something Bigger

‚Üí In this session, we're going to learn something amazing related to all over started after creating files through our **Terminal**.

## üíª Getting Started with Files

‚Üí Now we're going to get started by creating some files and performing some operations on it. Also including some commands that would be available at the end in the format of table if there are possibly some ways for it !

‚Üí **touch** : It is used for creating files in order to open them afterwards using the so called **nano** editor, and then start them again using for specific purposes. Below we have a usage guide or example for better understanding or explanation.

```bash
touch file_name.ext                 # you can easily create the file using this command

# for creating multiple files at once we can use the command given below
touch file_name.txt file_name.txt file_name.txt file_name.txt

# for checking if the file is created in your directory or not you can use the ls command
ls
```

‚Üí **cat** : It is used for creating and reading the data inside and of the file. We can use it in both the way ! Just the difference of the format for creating and using it with the new or already created files !

```bash
# for reading a file
cat file_name.ext

# for creating a file 
cat > file_name.ext
your content here !              # use CTRL + D once you have added the required content

# for creating new file we can use the format given below
cat << EOF > file_name.ext
your content here... !          # use EOF + ENTER for getting the content ended
```

‚Üí **echo** : Apart from just showing text on the screen or to the **Terminal** we can use it for creating file together by adding data to it. Below we have the usage guide for it, in order to add content and create new files using this command.

```bash
# creating new file with single line of echo command
echo "File content here..." > file_name.ext
```

‚Üí **mkdir** : It is used for creating directories and not only in case of **Linux** it is also used for **Windows** OS for creating directories or folder for storing our files for specific purposes and work ! Below we have the usage guide for it !

```bash
mkdir directory_name

# creating a parent directory and sub-directories at once
mkdir -p main_parent_directories/sub_directory/sub_directory/sub_directory
```

‚Üí **mv** : It is used for moving one or more files from one directory to other directory or folder. It is easy to use by the format given below ! Also you can consider it as guide or usecase for using this `mv` command !

```bash
mv file_name.ext ./directory_name           # remember to use ./ before the directory name in order to mark it as directory in the command

# from the command below we can also change the filename while moving it to a particular directory
mv file_name.ext ./directory_name/newfilename.ext

# for moving multiple files at once
mv file_name.ext file_name.ext ./directory_name
```

‚Üí **cp** : It is used in order to copy a particular file from one location or directory to other location or directory without changing its original content available in it. Below we have the usage guide for using it !

```bash
cp file_name.ext ./directory_name

# for renaming it together by copying it to other location
cp file_name.ext ./directory_name/newfilename.ext

# copying directories with all files to another directory
cp -r ./directory_name ./target_directory_name
```

‚Üí **Note** : If you want to check the view of files and directories we have a cool command `tree`, with the use of which we can actually get the view of current directory and all its files and sub-directories available in it ! And the commands **mv** and **cp** can also be used for copying and moving directories together with the files in the similar way, we do for files.

‚Üí **rm** : It is used for deleting the files directly either from the current directory or from the any other directory by providing proper location to him/her. Below we have the usage guide or example for it !

```bash
rm file_name.ext            # for removing single file

# for removing multiple files at once
rm file_name.ext file_name.ext

# removing directories
rmdir directory_name        # will only delete the directories if it is empty

# removing directories containing files
rm -r directory_name

# removing directory forcly
rm -rf directory_name
```

## Today's Task

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Perform different operations on files and directory including adding data to them, recreating, deleting the files and directories. Together by removing them whenever not needed by the **OS** and keep learning !
